= OpenJML Eclipse Launch Configurations =


== Existing Launch Configurations ==

They are located here <OpenJML source>/launchConfigs/ (todo add link to code)

=== Open JML-Plugin (Eclipse) ===

Is the default and launches a new Eclipse with the OpenJML installed
similar to the one you will get when installing openjml through eclipse - but not usefull for real development.

=== OpenJML-Test ===

Executes all the tests.

=== More ===
Some uses the prover setting so remembr to set the path to *yices*.


== Add new Launch Configurations == 

OpenJMLCommandLine is sane to have in mind for setting up the arguments.

Add these through OpenJML Eclipse workspace w. the sorce code. 

For the OpenJML go to properties.

Add on run configuration for each of Check|Compile|RAC

Remember to add each configuration as a *Java application* 
- screenshoot: http://screencast.com/t/xkTVb1Fza (todo add as real img).

=== Check ===

Project: OpenJML
Main: org.jmlspecs.openjml.Main
Program args: 
{{{
-noPurityCheck -g -check /tmp/openjml_tryouts/Foo.java -d /tmp/openjml_tryouts/openjml-compiled/
}}}
VM args: 
{{{
-Dopenjml.eclipseProjectLocation=${project_loc:OpenJML} -Dopenjml.eclipseSpecsProjectLocation=${project_loc:Specs}
}}}


=== Compile ===

Project: OpenJML
Main: org.jmlspecs.openjml.Main
Program args: 
{{{
-noPurityCheck -g -compile /tmp/openjml_tryouts/Foo.java -d /tmp/openjml_tryouts/openjml-compiled/
}}}
VM args: 
{{{
-Dopenjml.eclipseProjectLocation=${project_loc:OpenJML} -Dopenjml.eclipseSpecsProjectLocation=${project_loc:Specs}
}}}


=== RAC ===

Project: OpenJML
Main: org.jmlspecs.openjml.Main
Program args: 
{{{
-noPurityCheck -g -rac /tmp/openjml_tryouts/Foo.java -d /tmp/openjml_tryouts/openjml-compiled/
}}}
VM args: 
{{{
-Dopenjml.eclipseProjectLocation=${project_loc:OpenJML} -Dopenjml.eclipseSpecsProjectLocation=${project_loc:Specs}
}}}


All this can possible be added through the file system and set up in a more flexible way - just don't know now.




todo: add some screen shoots etc and more nots on setting up the 
run'ers as favorites and more...
