Outlining pre-requisits, what we did, etc.?

 == Current Implementation ==
Quantified expressions in OpenJML are currently implemented for a single declaration only. Our task is to generalize this behavior so that a quantified expression is also valid with multiple declarations.

Examlpe use case (the condition is pretty nonsensical whatsoever):
{{{
	//@ requires (\forall int i, j; 0 <= i && i < array.length && j == i++; array[i] == j);
	public static void foo (int[] array) {
		// Do something
	}
}}}

Further, the problem is how to determine the variable space in a smart way. Just iterating [int.MINVALuE, int.MAXVALUE] is going to take too long and produces a huge amount of overhead. Nevertheless, we will use this very naive approach for a first implementation which we will then refine iteratively.

  === Goals (in order of procedure) ===
   * Implement a function _f_ that evaluates _\forall_ expressions
     * from a string
     * from a JML-AST
   * Refine _f_ to accept multiple declarations
     * A nested for-loop might be a solution here!
   * Refine _f_ to process the guard smartly to avoid unneccesary overhead
   * Generalize _f_ to parse existential and universal quantifiers
   * Modify _f_ so it produces
     * Java source code as output
     * a Java-AST as output

 == Approaches Towards Quantified Expressions ==
Quantified expressions in JML are semantically defined in the following way:
{{{
(\forall D; P; Q);
}}}

where
 * _D_: a declaration of a race-variable
 * _P_: the guard which variables in D have to pass
 * _Q_: the predicate which has to be true variables passing P.
