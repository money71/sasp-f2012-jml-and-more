A few notes
===========

It's ment to run this example project both through eclipse and commandline. 


Structure for now
-----------------

* bin
  - for normal java compiled .class files
* jml-compiled
  - for JML 2 compiled .class files
* openjml-compiled
  - for OpenJML compiled .class files
* src
  - for examples files with no package naming (should be compatible/parse with
    both JML 22 and OpenJML - so no generics unless it work with flag *-G*).
* src_generics
  - for examples using generics and perhaps other stuff not compatible with JML 2.
* examples
  - for examples files with package naming
