Todo add path to source code and an short explaination.

== NonNullElementsBoiler.java ==

This is our boiler-plate class for the _\nonnullelements_ expression in OpenJML. The static class is holding two methods:

 * One checking the elements of the passed array consecutively until a null-reference is found or until there are no more elements to check
 * One checking all the elements of the passed array and returing in the end if there have been null-references.

While the former is, of course, saving computation time, the latter is more correct in a logical sense. However, from the outside both methods behave exactly the same, as indicated by both sharing the same specifications. These are created in reference to [Leino-Nelson-Saxe00] and read exactly like this:

{{{
    //@ requires o != null;
    //@ requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < o.length; o[i] != null);
    //@ ensures \result == true;
    //@ also
    //@ requires o == null || (\exists int i; 0 <= i && i < o.length; o[i] == null);
    //@ ensures \result == false;
}}}

*Checks:*

 * JML2 ESC - *Done*
 * JML2 compiler - *Done*
 * JML2 RAC
 * OpenJML ESC - *Done*
 * OpenJML compiler
 * OpenJML RAC

The latter two are not possible to perform as long as there is no \forall expression implemented in OpenJML.











== Ad hoc JML / OpenJML Q/A ==


=== What's \invariant_for ? ===

JML refman pdf p. 110:

{{{
    12.4.22 \invariant_for 
    invariant-for-expression ::= \invariant_for ( spec-expression ) 
    The \invariant_for operator returns true just when its argument satisfies
    the invariant of its static type; for example, \invariant_for((MyClass)o)
    is true when o satisfies the invariant of MyClass. The entire \invariant_for
    expression is of type boolean. 
}}}


lets show that within a *real example* - todo.
