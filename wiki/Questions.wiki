#summary Questions and maybe answers

= Collected Questions =

A collection of questions formulated based on findings in the code and project development.

== Recent == 
 * Does \nonnullelements not rely on a proper \forall implementation in RAC?
 * {{{//@ requires \nonnullelements o;}}} could basically be {{{\forall o, i; i < o.length; \nonnull o[i];}}}

== Development ==
 * To what extend are quantified expressions already implemented? ("RAC is implemented for expressions with just one declaration.")
 * Are quantified expressions being parsed at the moment? Where in the code?
 * Do RAC and ESC use the same parser?
 * Where are methods called that create checks (assertions)?
 * Where is the main-method for the RAC?

== Concepts ==
 * Is the main task to evaluate a \forall expression?
 * Is the main task to generate proper assertions fo a \forall expression?
 * We'd rather go for multiple easier tasks than a single hard one (nullabl,e, fresh...)
