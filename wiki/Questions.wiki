#summary Questions and maybe answers

= Collected Questions =

A collection of questions formulated based on findings in the code and project development.

== Development ==
 * To what extend are quantified expressions already implemented? ("RAC is implemented for expressions with just one declaration.")
 * Are quantified expressions being parsed at the moment? Where in the code?
 * Do RAC and ESC use the same parser?
 * Where are methods called that create checks (assertions)?
 * Where is the main-method for the RAC?

== Concepts ==
 * Is the main task to evaluate a \forall expression?
 * Is the main task to generate proper assertions fo a \forall expression?
 * We'd rather go for multiple easier tasks than a single hard one (nullabl,e, fresh...)

= Meeting notes with Joe, 08/05/2012 = 
 * AST node relating to universal quantifier
 * Eclipse search "where in the code is this constant referenced?"
 * Friday Analog with Joe, 11.00am
 * regarding jml2 bug: find switch for using javac instead of multi-java

== Tasks ==
 * Get command-line build in Eclipse up and running 
  ** Step through code while parsing code examples
 * Code-diving
  ** Write small \non_null example (2-liner)
  ** Put examples in JMLExamlpes/ on googlecode
  ** Search through codebase by hand + write docs
 * Find working modifiers in OpenJML
  ** Write example files for those
  ** Put them also in JMLExamples/
 * Find equivalent implementation in JML2
 * ?
