#summary Notes on various meetings

= Question for the next meeting =

 * What about recursive deepening for multi-dimensional arrays or nested lists?
 * _\nonnullelements_ for instances of _Collection_?
 * What is _desugaring_?
 * _\forall_ is implemented but limited to one race-variable -> change parser behavior?
 * Should _\nonnullelements_ not be a product of _\non_null_, _\forall_?

= Meeting Notes =

== Meeting with Joe, 11.05.2012, 11.00 ==

 * not yet conducted

== Meeting with Joe, 8.05.2012, 10.15 ==
 * AST node relating to universal quantifier
 * Eclipse search "where in the code is this constant referenced?"
 * Friday Analog with Joe, 11.00am

== Meeting with Joe, 1.05.2012, 16.00 ==
 * JML2 is most advanced and working -> use it for homework!
 * "An overview over JML Tools" - Joes's website
 * Project -> Validated Type checker for universes

 === Universes ===
 * Specify ownership-relations
 * "Hot area" for the past twelve years
 * Who owns whom?
 * /readonly, /rep, /any
 * RAC or ESC??

 ==== Levels of project ====
 * 1. implement core basic unit type checker without testing or contracts
 * 2. + validation via contracts and unit testing (translating rules into contracts)
 * 3. + implement universe variants

 === Quantifiers in RAC for OpenJML ===
 * How to translate quantified expression into executable code?
 * Also several papers published on that

 === \nonnull ===
 * No runtime checking for that
 * Build!

 === \fresh ===
 * Specify that an object is new
 * Meaning, newly created

 === \assignable ===
 * "Frame axioms"
 * Runtime checking is absolutely novel
 * Kinda heavyweight
